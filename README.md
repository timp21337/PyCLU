PyCLU - Python Convert Length Units
===================================

A simple library that converts lengths in different units.
For example:

    6 m to yards = 6.562 yd
    2.5 yd to inches = 90 in
    2 ft 10 in to inches = 34 in

The units supported are: metres (m), yards (yd) and inches (in).
The design of the library supports adding new units easily.

It also supports representing the measures as full strings
(e.g. "2.3 metres", "6 yards", "0.4 inches").
